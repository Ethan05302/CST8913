# Migration Plan for Toyota

## 1. What are the company's motivators of migration to the cloud?
Toyota is migrating to the cloud for several key reasons:
1. Production Efficiency: By using cloud services, Toyota aims to improve production efficiency through real-time data analysis, which can help reduce downtime and waste.
2. Smart Manufacturing: Cloud solutions can help Toyota connect and manage devices on the production line more effectively, supporting IoT (Internet of Things) integration.
3. Scalability: Cloud platforms offer the flexibility to scale Toyota's global operations more easily, especially as the company expands.
4. Security and Compliance: Migrating to the cloud allows Toyota to better protect data and meet global security and compliance standards.

## 2. What questions will you ask to understand more about the company infrastructure?
To understand Toyota's infrastructure better, I would ask the following questions:
1. What are the key systems currently supporting production at Toyota?
2. How is data collected and stored from machines on the production floor?
3. What are the storage and processing requirements for the production data?

## 3. Migration Stakeholders
The stakeholders involved in the migration include:
- Project Manager: Overseeing the entire migration process.
- Cloud Architect: Designing the cloud architecture and overseeing the technical aspects.
- IT Administrator: Ensuring the integration and security of IT systems.
- IoT Specialist: Ensuring that IoT devices are properly integrated with the cloud.
- Security Team: Handling data protection and compliance requirements.
- Factory Managers: Ensuring the cloud solution meets the operational needs of the production line.

## 4. Describe the most likely migration approach that will suit the chosen company.
The most suitable migration approach for Toyota would be Refactor:
- Refactoring allows Toyota to modify their current systems so they can work efficiently with cloud platforms. This method helps Toyota keep their existing systems but adapt them for better integration with cloud-based services, particularly for IoT devices and data analytics.

## 5. Produce a high-level schedule for the migration process
The migration process will follow this simple timeline:
- Week 1-2: Assess the current systems and plan the migration.
- Week 3-4: Set up the cloud environment and prepare the resources.
- Week 5-6: Migrate data and integrate IoT devices.
- Week 7: Test the new system.
- Week 8: Deploy the solution and go live.
- Week 9-10: Monitor and optimize the system after migration.

## 6. What are the main decision criteria for the chosen company?
Toyota’s main decision factors for selecting a cloud solution include:
1. Scalability: The cloud solution should support Toyota’s global growth and operational needs.
2. IoT Integration: It should enable seamless integration with IoT devices for better monitoring and control.
3. Security: The cloud solution must comply with global security standards and ensure data protection.
4. Cost-effectiveness: The cloud should help Toyota reduce costs and increase productivity.
